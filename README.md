# Zak Laurence E. Beltran - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About Me

Hey hey hey! I am **Zak Laurence E. Beltran**! I am currently a fourth-year **Mathematics and Computer Science student**. I have a strong background in analytics, modeling, statistics, and programming.

I have a passion for turning data into valuable insights through statistical modeling, forecasting, and data visualization. With my strong mathematical and technical background, I am eager to navigate through the field of data science.

## Projects

This section lists all the relevant projects I have created or participated in, including both side projects and school projects.

### Daily Sales Forecasting using ARIMAX with MLR Analysis as Possible Feature Selection on Regressors

**Project Folder:** [daily-sales-forecast-arimax-mlr](https://github.com/zkbltrn/data-analyst-portfolio/tree/main/daily-sales-forecast-arimax-mlr)

**Main Objective:** To select significant factors that affect daily sales of a local business and to forecast from highly volatile data

**Description:** A brute force method was implemented beforehand, trying all possible combinations of regressors simultaneous to the model fitting phase with the use of R's auto ARIMA function. To further investigate, MLR Analysis and backward elimination was used to select the possible regressors in creating an ARIMAX model. Three ARIMAX models are then shortlisted: Best RMSE, Best MAPE, and MLR Method. Afterwards, the final model is selected via visual comparison and intuition.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, feature selection, time-series modeling, forecasting, residual diagnostics, data visualization

**Tools:** RStudio (R), Jamovi, Excel

**Results:** Forecasting model (ARIMAX) identified promotions, local festivals, and social media posts as key drivers of daily café sales. ARIMAX model demonstrated an improvement of 9.5% MAPE compared to an ARIMA baseline model.
